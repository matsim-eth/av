## Working with the repository

- The latest changes are in the `master` branch. The version there is always a SNAPSHOT version. If you want to use it, clone the git repository, or use the [packagecloud](https://packagecloud.io/eth-ivt/matsim/packages/java/ch.ethz.matsim/av-0.1.2-SNAPSHOT.jar) repository.
- Release versions are committed to the `releases` branch. Whenever something is pushed to this branch, a release is built and pushed to [Bintray](https://bintray.com/matsim-eth/matsim/av) (given that the new version in pom.xml is valid)
